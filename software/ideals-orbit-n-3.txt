File name = n-3-k-1-i-1.bit8, file size = 2, number of semigroups = 1
File name = n-3-k-2-i-2.bit8, file size = 4, number of semigroups = 2
File name = n-3-k-3-i-1.bit8, file size = 2, number of semigroups = 1
Calculating polynomial for n=3
a^I_3(FS_r) = (1/1!)*( 1*1 )*r
+ (1/2!)*( 2*2 )*r*(r-1)
+ (1/3!)*( 1*1 )*r*(r-1)*(r-2)
Simplifying polynomial
a^I_3(FS_r)=(1/6)*r^3+(3/2)*r^2-(2/3)*r
