This page describes the software I wrote for counting subsemigroups, ideals and congruences of free semigroups. For background material and a description of the algorithms used, see
<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11856-016-1384-8">this paper</a>.
<br><br>
For a summary of the results of these computations see <a href="tables.html">here</a>.
<br><br>
<span id="heading";>FISOFS</span>
<br><br>
This is a collection of C++ files for constructing all finite (Rees) index subsemigroups of free semigroups, quite lamely called 'FISOFS'. It is recursive in nature, calculating the index n subsemigroups from
those of index n-1.
<br><br>
For free rank equal to 1 the number of subsemigroups grows asymptotically like the Fibonacci numbers, for free rank greater than 1, they grow superexponentially (i.e. there are a lot of them!) Therefore it was written with the intention of being run in parallel to make use of available HPC facilities.
<br><br>
We ran the code on the
<a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/isolutions/staff/iridis.page">Iridis 4</a>
compute cluster and calculated all subsemigroups of index 9. The 9th polynomial took 2 hours 30 minutes to compute (this would have taken approximately one week on a standard desktop computer).
<br><br>
You can download the source code

or visit the GitHub repository

<br><br>
You can also download precomputed data files up to index 8 here:
<br>
<ul>
<li>
For
<a href="subsgps-2-7.tar.gz">index 2 through 7</a>
(7.8MB, extracted 57MB).
</li>
<li>
For index 8
[<a href="subsgps-8a.tar.gz">file 1</a>,
<a href="subsgps-8b.tar.gz">file 2</a>]
(178MB, extracted 1.8GB).
</li>
</ul>

<span id="heading">FIIOFS</span>
<br><br>
This is almost identical to the code above except it calculates (Rees) index n ideals of free semigroups.

You can download precomputed data files here:

<ul>

For index <a href="ideals-2-12.tar.gz">2 through 12</a> (350KB, extracted 4.1MB)
</li>
<li>
For index <a href="ideals-2-25.tar.gz">2 through 25</a>, just for support 1 and 2 (34MB, extracted 871MB)
</li>

<span id="heading">Congruences</span>
<br><br>
<a href="asc-gen-tables.g">Here</a>
is the GAP code I used to calculate the number of 'ascendingly generated' Cayley tables which was used to
<a href="get_exp.g">calculate</a>
the number of n class congruences on the free semigroups, up to n=7. It makes use of the Smallsemi data library.
